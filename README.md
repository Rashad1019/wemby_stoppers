## Victor Wembanyama Defensive Matchup Analysis

### Project Overview
This project analyzes how NBA teams have defended Victor Wembanyama across his first 122 career games (2023-24 to early 2025-26). It identifies personnel traits and defensive schemes that most effectively reduce his scoring, quantifies the gaps between effective and vulnerable approaches, and offers actionable frameworks for coaches, analysts, and front offices.

### Business Impact
- **Game planning**: Provides evidence-based defensive archetypes (e.g., Length Matching, Swarm & Switch) to reduce Wembanyama’s scoring by 15–45% depending on personnel and discipline.
- **Roster construction**: Quantifies the premium on length, rim protection, and switchable defenders for matchups against elite bigs.
- **Player development and scouting**: Highlights counters San Antonio can develop (post game, playmaking, mid-range) and what opposing teams should monitor over time.

### How to Interpret Results
- Use the four defensive archetypes and tiered decision framework to align your scheme with available personnel.
